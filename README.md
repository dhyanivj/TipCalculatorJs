Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css

  color: papayawhip;
}
```

const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
